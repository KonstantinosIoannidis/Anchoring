    Welcome to this experiment.
    Please read the following instructions carefully.
    We ask that you do not communicate with other participants during the experiment.
    The use of mobile phones is not allowed during this experiment.
    If you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind, at any time, an experimenter will assist you privately.
    The data collected through this experiment does not include your name or any other information that would allow your identification.
    All of the data you provide during the experiment cannot be traced back to you.
</p>

<p>
    Your earnings in todayâ€™s session will consist of money and/or a {{auctioned_item}}.
    You will start the experiment with a capital of {{participation_fee|c}}.
    Besides this starting capital, your earnings will depend on your own decisions and may depend on other participants' decisions.
</p>

<p>
    The {{auctioned_item}} is {{wine_type}}. The {{auctioned_item}} is <b>different</b> in every session of this experiment.

</p>

<p>
    In this experiment you will make {{num_decisions}} decisions in total.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the experiment, one of your {{num_decisions}} decisions will be selected at random.
    Only this decision will determine your earnings (possibly in combination with the decisions of other participants).
    Your earnings for this decision will be added to your starting capital of {{participation_fee|c}}.
    You will privately receive your earnings at the end of the experiment.
</p>

<p>
    For each decision you will receive some instructions.
    You will only receive the instructions of a subsequent decision if a previous decision is completely finished.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you for your participation.
