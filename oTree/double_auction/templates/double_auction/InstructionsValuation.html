        <p>If this decision is selected at the end of the experiment,
            a random price will be drawn between â‚¬0.00 and
            what the experimenter estimates to be the maximum price any buyer would be willing to pay.
            Then one of the following will happen:
        </p>

                <ol type="a">
                <li>If the random price is smaller than the price you reported,
                    then you keep the {{auctioned_item}}.</li>
                <li>If the random price is larger or equal to the price you reported,
                    then the experimenter will buy the {{auctioned_item}} from you and you will receive the random price.</li>
                </ol>

        <p><b>You will not receive the price you reported. Instead you may receive the random price drawn.</b>
            The reported price has no impact on the random price as the price was drawn before the experiment started.
        </p>

        <p>It is in your best interest to report a price that equals your true valuation for the {{auctioned_item}}.</p>
